# Digital-Logic-Keypad-Lock
An Arduino-based digital logic keypad lock that demonstrates hardware-level password verification using external TTL ICs. A 4×4 keypad provides binary input, which is processed by a flip-flop and logic comparison circuit. The system controls a relay-driven solenoid lock with LED and buzzer indicators for access status.
